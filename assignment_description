Assignment to be done individually
Objectives
The main objective of this assignment is to understand the concepts of encryption, de-
cryption and cryptanalysis. You will have to decrypt a number of cipher text messages,
sometimes knowing which algorithm or which key has been used, sometimes not know-
ing which algorithm and which key has been used. In order to do this, you will need to
understand many classic encryption algorithms and you might need to write programs to
help you decrypt ciphertext messages. The following programming languages are allowed:
Python, C and Java. For C, you cannot use Visual Studio or something similar, but you
can use gcc or clang in a Linux environment similar to the one used for the Programming
Techniques course. For Java, using NetBeans or IntelliJ is acceptable, and for python, any
developing environment is OK.
Assume all messages use this alphabet:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ .,:;()-!?$’"\n0123456789
Please note that there is a space between the Z and the . in the alphabet given above.
Also, \n represents only one character and has the usual meaning of a new line character.
The 2 characters between the dollar sign $ and the new line character are the single quote
and the double quote characters.
Part 1
Decrypt the following messages. All of these messages are available in separate text files.
Using separate text files will help avoid any issues with counting the number of spaces and
1
new line characters correctly.
You have to show your work for every question. If you solve the problem ”by hand”,
you have to explain how you solved the problem. If you wrote a program to solve the
problem, you have to submit your source code with an explanation of how you used it to
solve the problem. You must write your own programs: you cannot download software
from the internet or ”borrow” source code from other students. Plagiarism rules will be
applied very strictly in the marking of this assignment.
1. File: msg1.enc, algorithm: Ceasar, key: unknown.
2. File: msg2.enc, algorithm: Columnar Transposition, key: unknown.
3. File: msg3.enc, algorithm: Random Substitution, key: unknown.
4. File: msg4.enc, algorithm: unknown, key: 12.
5. File: msg5.enc, algorithm: Vernam (addition), key: unknown.
6. File: msg6.enc, algorithm: unknown, key: unknown.
Part 2
Encrypted messages will be sent by email to the Google group email address. You have to
decrypt at least 4 of these messages, and show your work, in order to be able to get full
marks for this part. The rules will be the same as for part 1. But there is going to be an
opportunity to get extra marks for the students who decrypt each message the fastest.
Each message will be associated to 1 extra mark (out of 15), to be split among the 3 fastest
students. The fastest student will receive 0.6 extra mark, the second fastest will receive
0.25 extra mark, and the third fastest 0.15 extra mark. If only 2 students decrypt the
message, the split will be 0.7 and 0.3, and if only 1 student decrypts the message, he/she
will get the full 1 extra mark.
Submission and Marking
Create a folder named COSC2539 A1 s1234567 and put all your files in it. Create 2 Google
Docs inside your folder, named COSC2539 A1 s1234567 part1 and COSC2539 A1 s1234567 part2.
These documents should contain the decrypted messages and the explanations of how you
decrypted them, for each part of the assignment. Do not include source code in these doc-
uments. Create an archive (either in zip or 7z format) containing your source code. Name
your archive COSC2539 A1 s1234567 src.zip or COSC2539 A1 s1234567 src.7z. Don’t
forget to replace s1234567 with your actual student ID.
Share your COSC2539 A1 s1234567 folder with the lecturer in edit mode. Don’t wait
until the last day to share your folder. You can share it early, and keep adding files to it or
2
making updates to your files. Your COSC2539 A1 s1234567 part1 file will be marked only
after the due date, but your COSC2539 A1 s1234567 part2 file will be partially marked as
soon as possible after you submit your answer to the encrypted messages sent by email. To
submit an answer for an individual message to get a chance to get extra marks, edit your
part2 file and upload your source code (if necessary), then reply to the email containing
the encrypted message to notify the lecturer you have found the solution. Do not include
the answer in the email, just send a notification that you found it. Make sure your files
have been shared correctly and that you label your answers correctly in your documents.
Do not modify your documents after the due date. The usual 10%/day, maximum 5
late days will apply. This assignment is worth 15% of your total mark for the course.
